## Porgramming ##
Before assembling the product, unglue the battery from the board to access the programming header. You'll need a ESP32 programming dongle with control of the EN and IO0 pins. The USB connector is not wired to the USB pins of the ESP32-S3 USB interface and can only be used for charging.
